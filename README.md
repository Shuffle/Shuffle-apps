# Shuffle Apps
This is a repository for apps to be used in Shuffle: https://shuffler.io. 

**PS:** These apps should be valid with WALKOFF, but the SDK is different, meaning you have to change the FIRST line in each Dockerfile (FROM docker.io/frikky/shuffle:app_sdk).

# OpenAPI
Apps in this repository are mostly manually made. Shuffle is striving for standardization and accessability, and our effort is focused on OpenAPI rather than manual work. With this in mind, most app creation that supports REST API's will be continued here.

# License
All apps, workflows and modular parts of Shuffle including our App SDK is under licensed under MIT, meaning you can freely use it anywhere in any way you want.
